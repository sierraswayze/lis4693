Native women have always had a sacred
and powerful role in our communities.
Not only as aunties,
mamas, and grandmas
– although those are some very important jobs, too.
But also as holy women, healers, and leaders.
And across cultures and languages,
Native oral traditions are brimming
with some pretty divine female figures.
Protectors of land and sea.
Creation and destruction.
Life and death.
Hi, I’m Lily Gladstone
and this is Crash Course,
Native American History.
[THEME MUSIC]
Well before Europeans arrived
in what is now North America,
Native beliefs around gender were
—and honestly still are—pretty diverse.
In fact, many Native American
tribes are matriarchal,
meaning women hold significant
power in our communities,
including as the primary decision-makers.
Matriarchal tribes, then and now,
tend to value ideas such as equality,
consensus finding, gift giving,
and peace building.
For example, with Navajo, or Dine’,
mothers and grandmothers serve as
the matriarchs, or the heads of individual clans.
While men usually are leading intertribal
meetings and making decisions about war,
women have the final say
when it comes to clan disputes.
They control their own land,
their own livestock, their own crafts
– and any money they earn, they keep.
Dine’ are also matrilineal, meaning family
heritage is passed through the mother’s line.
This equality can be found
in Dine’ spirituality, too.
Both men and women are allowed
to become Medicine People,
traditional healers who perform
ceremonies for the sick.
It’s said that Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé,
or Changing Woman,
explained it to the Sun,
the father of her children, like this:
“You are of sky, I am of earth …
Remember, as different
as we are, you and I,
we are of one spirit …
we are of equal worth.”
And back in the day, while Dine’
women didn’t join raids or go to war,
women in other tribes did, mine included—
her name was Running Eagle, Pi'tamaka.
Among a lot of Native nations,
women would often lead war
parties and participate in battles.
How about Buffalo Calf Road Woman,
of the Northern Cheyenne in what is now Montana.
In the late 1800s, she and her family
were camping near a creek
when a group of white soldiers attacked.
When her brother fell in the fight,
she rode into battle and rescued him.
About a week later, with her Colt 45,
Buffalo Calf Road Woman would fight
in the Battle of the Little Bighorn.
And though we don’t know for sure,
there are plenty of stories
from several tribal nations
that claim it was a woman
who dealt Custer the final blow.
Other Native women took on the roles
of leaders and diplomats in times of conflict.
In fact, one of the strongest Native American
confederacies, the Haudenosaunee,
was co-founded by a Native
woman named Jikonsaseh.
Let me tell you her story…
[snaps fingers]
Ooh!
Way back before European arrival,
there were five warring nations:
the Cayuga, the Mohawk, Oneida,
Onondaga, and Seneca.
Jikonsaseh didn’t want any part of that war.
But she lived along a war road,
one that warriors from every nation traveled.
So instead of shutting the door
and turning them away,
she offered shelter and food
to anyone who came through.
She even helped resolve arguments
between members of different nations.
Meanwhile, a man named Peacemaker was
looking to end the war and unify the five nations.
Which makes sense, with a name like that!
After hearing about Jikonsaseh, Peacemaker
set out to see her kindness for himself.
He told her about his vision for a unified nation,
describing a longhouse with a representative
from each nation in their own seat.
Because she was neutral – and well-liked –
Peacemaker asked Jikonsaseh to assist him in 
establishing a system of 
governance based on peace.
He gave her the name “Mother of Nations”.
And she would go on to be instrumental
in the formation of the
Haudenosaunee Confederacy.
Thanks in part to Jikonsaseh,
Haudenosaunee law recognizes
the equal responsibilities
of women and men in all manners,
which still guides their practices today.
That’s right. In that good way.
And that’s the story of Jikonsaseh.
Mmm… mmhmm.
All these women are definitely inspiring,
but not every Native American tribe has
treated women and men as equals.
Which has become something 
of a sticky misconception.
And while it is flattering,
it’s also flattening
– because it smoothes out the diversity
among Native American cultures.
While we’re all pretty awesome,
we’re also hundreds of different tribes,
with different cultures and values.
Like, not all tribes were matriarchal.
Some divided labor strictly along gender lines.
In others, men held most
of the wealth and power.
And to add a further twist,
Native people didn’t always think about
gender in the same way as Europeans.
In Diné culture, for example, the Nádleehi
embrace both masculine and feminine energies,
and the Diné view them as sacred.
And Native Hawaiians have historically
recognized people who identify as māhū,
a word that goes beyond gender and
serves as a bridge between male and female.
The point is, while plenty of Native cultures
had some equality between men and women,
there was also no single way 
of thinking about gender.
But, the onset of European
colonization disrupted gender roles,
as it did so many other things.
So. Many. 
Europeans didn’t vibe with the way
women held power in many Native societies.
As Laguna Pueblo scholar
Paula Gunn Allen put it,
“The colonizers saw (and rightly)
that as long as women held
unquestioned power of such magnitude,
attempts at a total conquest
of the continents were bound to fail.”
The Northern Cheyenne have a saying:
“A nation is not defeated until the
hearts of its women are on the ground.”
So, colonizers got to work dismantling that power.
They stripped Native women of the roles
and rights they had had for centuries.
At times, this looked like
elevating men to positions of power.
But more often than not,
it came in the form of
violence toward Native women.
Now, we’re about to get into some dark history.
This is heavy stuff, and 
it’s important to take care.
Violence against Native women
wasn’t a passive byproduct of colonization.
It was targeted and strategic.
Women were often singled out
because of their ability to bear children
– the very thing that was seen
as sacred by many tribes.
By killing Native women, colonizers
could destabilize Native populations.
Which was part of a broader effort
to destroy and replace Native people
with European settlers.
That’s a core part of settler-colonialism,
which you can learn more about in episode 1.
This violence had disastrous,
and widespread, consequences.
Thousands of Native women
were abused and killed.
And tribal culture was permanently
altered for many Native nations.
Like the Choctaw, whose matrilineal system
of heritage was marginalized by colonial society.
Unfortunately, this type of violence continued
to haunt the United States for centuries.
It still does.
For example, in the 1970s,
the federal government authorized the
secret sterilization of thousands of Native women,
at least 36 of whom
were under the age of 21.
One study found that,
between 1973 and 1976,
1 in 4 American Indian women
were sterilized without their consent.
Some scholars have described
violence against Native women as “rare”
in Native American societies
before the arrival of Europeans.
Though today, it’s a very different story.
Native American women face some of
the highest rates of violence in the nation,
and nearly 96 percent of it
is committed by non-Natives.
The CDC’s data from 2018 to 2023
shows that the third leading cause of death
for Native women ages
15 to 24 was homicide.
And for ages 25 to 44,
it’s in the top ten.
Those numbers likely underrepresent
the actual scale of violence.
A 2022 report by Amnesty International
found that most law enforcement agencies
either don’t record Native women’s ethnicity,
mislabel them as “Hispanic,”
or lump them into a catch-all category of “other.”
This has caused an untold number 
of Native women’s stories 
to effectively disappear.
To make matters worse,
crimes in Indian Country
are difficult to bring to justice
because, in many cases,
Native American law enforcement
isn’t able to prosecute non-Native criminals.
We get more into this and other
complications of federal Indian law in episode 16.
Thankfully, Native activism is making
some headway on this front.
The Missing and Murdered Indigenous
Women movement, or MMIW,
is spreading awareness and advocating
for policy change to address
the violence against Indigenous women,
Indigenous femmes, Indigenous two spirit,
and Indigenous girls.
And it’s making an impact!
In 2020, thanks in part to this activism,
the Not Invisible Act was signed into law.
It created a federal commission
to develop methods for
“identifying, reporting, and responding
to instances of missing persons, murder,
and human trafficking on
Indian lands and of Indians.”
The act itself was authored by
then-Representative Deb Haaland,
a member of the Laguna Pueblo Nation –
and the first Native woman to serve
as U.S. Secretary of the Interior.
Hey, the first Indian head of
the Bureau of Indian Affairs?
How revolutionary!
Thank you, Deb.
Thank you, Deb.
And, of course, activism and leadership
by Native American women is nothing new,
and extends beyond the scope of MMIW alone.
Consider Ladonna Harris,
a Comanche activist who in the 1960s
spearheaded Oklahomans for Indian Opportunity
— the very first intertribal coalition in  
the state.
This was a big deal in an era when
people from many different Native nations
had begun coming together in new and
powerful ways to advocate for improved conditions.
Harris went on to serve on Lyndon B. Johnson’s
National Council on Indian Opportunity
and later to found Americans 
for Indian Opportunity,
a much broader version of
the work she’d begun in Oklahoma.
And let’s hear it for Elouise Cobell,
also known as Yellow Bird Woman.
She was a Tribal Elder, activist, banker,
and a member of the Blackfeet Nation,
who grew up hearing stories
about tribal members
not getting payments they were
owed for use of their land,
held in trust by the federal government.
Years later, when she became
treasurer of the Blackfeet Nation,
she witnessed evidence of it herself.
She found records of oil being extracted
from Blackfeet land, but no record of any payments.
So in 1996, Cobell led the charge
in holding the government accountable.
She brought a class-action lawsuit
against the United States
for mismanaging trust funds
of over 500,000 Native Americans.
It was a long fight, but 
in 2010, Cobell v. Salazar 
culminated in a 3.4 billion dollar settlement
that went toward getting tribal members
the payments they were owed,
restoring fractionated land to tribal governments,
and starting a scholarship fund.
Rest in peace, Elouise.
And plenty of non-Native women have been
inspired by the work of Native women,
including many early American feminists.
Take Matilda Joslyn Gage, a nineteenth-century
leader in the women’s suffrage movement.
She grew up in New York State
where the Haudenosaunee Confederacy was based.
You know, the one our girl 
Jikonsaseh helped establish.
As she and others became increasingly frustrated
by resistance to the women’s movement,
they found inspiration in 
their Indigenous neighbors.
Gage once wrote of the
Haudenosaunee Confederacy:
“Never was justice more perfect;
never was civilization higher.”
The point is: Native women impact
more than just Native history
– we impact all history.
Despite centuries of oppression
and violence, we’re still here.
Imparting wisdom, advocating for change, 
exercising leadership, and 
lifting up Native voices.
Which is as important today as it ever was.
In our next episode, we’re going to take a look
at the way modern tribal governments operate.
Good luck, Che.
