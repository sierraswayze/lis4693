        "For the video in the first lab, I chose a video about native women. Being a female native american, I always find it interesting how women are seen as powerful and important. What went well for this assignment was having a much better understanding of how GitHub and Colab work and function. I didn't feel that I was as lost and the functionality was much simpler. What didn't go well at first was identifying the url needed to perform the import function. I was not pulling the actual file path, but the path to the folder. So this initially caused an issue with the first task of identifying the number of characters and first 100 characters of the transcript. Once I pulled the raw file I was able to copy the url and proceed with the assignment."
